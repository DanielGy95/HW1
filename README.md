    * only works if `IJulia` is part of your current environment.
    * if it's not, just do `using InstantiateFromURL; activate_github("QuantEcon/QuantEconLecturePackages", tag = "v0.9.5");` before saying `using IJulia`
3. open a notebook server by typing `notebook(dir="/Users/florian.oswald/Downloads")` [you have to change the `dir` argument!]
